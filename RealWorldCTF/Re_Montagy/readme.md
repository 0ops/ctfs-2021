## Background

This challenge, `Re:Montagy`, is the revenge version of `Montagy` in RealWorldCTF 2019 Final. If you are not familiar with the previous challenge, [this blog](https://x9453.github.io/2020/01/26/Real-World-CTF-Finals-2019-Montagy/) is worth reading. `Montagy` is solved unintendedly, and actually our solution to `Re:Montagy` is the only intended one during the contest.

## Writeup

Two contracts' source code are provided, let's check `Montagy`'s first:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.11;

contract Montagy{
    address payable public owner;
    mapping(bytes32=>uint256) registeredIDLength;
    mapping(address=>bytes32) puzzleID;
    ...
    modifier onlyPuzzle(){
        require(puzzleID[msg.sender] != 0);
        _;
    }

    function registerCode(bytes memory a) public onlyOwner {
        registeredIDLength[tag(a)] = a.length;
    }

    function newPuzzle(bytes memory code) public returns(address addr){
        bytes32 id = tag(code);
        require(registeredIDLength[id] == code.length);

        addr = deploy(code);
        lastchildaddr = addr;
        puzzleID[addr] = id;
    }

    function solve(string memory info) public onlyPuzzle {
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
        winnerinfo = info;
    }
    ...
    function tag(bytes memory a) pure public returns(bytes32 cs){
        assembly{
            let groupsize := 16
            let head := add(a,groupsize)
            let tail := add(head, mload(a))
            let t1 := 0x21711730
            let t2 := 0x7312f103
            let m1,m2,m3,m4,p1,p2,p3,s,tmp
            for { let i := head } lt(i, tail) { i := add(i, groupsize) } {
                s := 0x6644498b
                tmp := mload(i)
                m1 := and(tmp,0xffffffff)
                m2 := and(shr(0x20,tmp),0xffffffff)
                m3 := and(shr(0x40,tmp),0xffffffff)
                m4 := and(shr(0x60,tmp),0xffffffff)
                for { let j := 0 } lt(j, 0x10) { j := add(j, 1) } {
                    s := and(add(s, 0x68696e74),0xffffffff)
                    p1 := sub(mul(t1, 0x10), m1)
                    p2 := add(t1, s)
                    p3 := add(div(t1,0x20), m2)
                    t2 := and(add(t2, xor(p1,xor(p2,p3))), 0xffffffff)
                    p1 := add(mul(t2, 0x10), m3)
                    p2 := add(t2, s)
                    p3 := sub(div(t2,0x20), m4)
                    t1 := and(add(t1, xor(p1,xor(p2,p3))), 0xffffffff)
                }
            }
            cs := xor(mul(t1,0x100000000),t2)
        }
    }
}

```

The server makes three transactions. The first deploys `Montagy` with 0.1 ether. The second calls `registerCode` with the bytecode of contract `Puzzle`. Finally `newPuzzle` is called with the same parameter, and `Puzzle` is deployed.

Our goal is to empty the balance of contract `Montagy`, and the only way is calling `solve` from the puzzle it deployed. Let's check `Puzzle`'s source code now:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.11;

contract Puzzle{
    ...
    function loose() view public returns(bool){
        uint256 t1 = (a^b^c)+(d^e^f)+(g^h^i);
        uint256 t2 = (a+d+g)^(b+e+h)^(c+f+i);
        require(t1 + t2 < 0xaabbccdd);
        require(t1 > 0x8261e26b90505061031256e5afb60721cb);
        require(0xf35b6080614321368282376084810151606401816080016143855161051756 >= t1*t2);
        require(t1 - t2 >= 0x65e670d9bd540cea22fdab97e36840e2);
        return true;
    }
    function harsh(bytes memory seed, string memory info) public{
        require(loose());
        if (keccak256(seed) == bytes32(bytes18(0x6111d850336107ef16565b908018915a9056))) {
            server.solve(info);
        }
    }
}
```

Though we can find answers to `loose()`, it is impossible to pass the keccak256 challenge. The `Puzzle` is unsolvable! Noticing we can call `newPuzzle` to deploy other puzzles as long as the length and `tag` matches, let's dive into the `tag` function.

The `tag` function implements TEA to compress/hash the input. It encrpts `t1` and `t2` continuously with `input[16*i:16*(i+1)]` as keys. A quick diff shows that `lt(j, 0x10)` was `lt(j, 0x4)` in the previous challenge, suggesting that bruteforcing the tag may not be the intended solution (although other teams still managed to do so).

TEA suffers from equivalent keys. In `tag` function, the 16 bytes of key is separated into `m1~m4`, 4 bytes each. If we flip the MSB of both `m1` and `m2`, or both `m3` and `m4`, or all the four, the encryption result won't change, therefore we can change some pairs of opcodes of  `Puzzle` without changing the `tag`. To be more specfic, the pairs should be located at `0x...0` and `0x...4`, or `0x...8` and `0x...c`. Then the question is where to change?

The consts in `Puzzle` seems weird, why not try disassembling them?

Amazing! And the `PUSH` opcode before the consts are located at somewhere we can flip, a strong hint that we are on the right track! (except the useless third)

The controll flow changes. When we reach the line `require(t1 > 0x8261e26b90505061031256e5afb60721cb)`, we will jump to `0x0312`, which is `JUMPDEST` in the second backdoor, then some part of our calldata is copied to the memory. Then we jump to `0x0517`, which takes some 2-byte pieces from our calldata to the stack, then jump to the first piece. Now we can controll the next JOP(Jump Oriented Programming) destination. 

After flipping, `00000374 PUSH18(71)` becomes `CALL(F1)`. Now there are two `CALL` opcodes. First we attempted to use the original one, but all trials failed (either fail to pass the keccak check, or end up with a uncontrollable jump address). Everything is clearer when we decide to make full use of the backdoors, including the flipped `CALL`. We have `0x049E` gadget to load the `Montagy` address from storage, and the `00000374` backdoor to load gas (second half) and make the `CALL` (first half). Other params for `CALL` have been already prepared, and the calling data is what `0x0312` has copied.

Finally after the `CALL`, the pseudocode is `JUMP(msg.sender&0x07ef)`. We can find accounts to land at `JUMPDEST; STOP` to finish the execution.

Then comes the flag! `rwctf{rE7uRn_2_FuTuR3_w1Th_1_cUp_f0_T_f70M_7He_P4s7_THATs_C4l13d_M0N74GY!}`

## exploit

Nope. My exploit is ugly and contains a lot of private keys, and I'm too lazy to tidy things up. However, you may try to find my exploit transactions on rinkeby and reproduce it lol.
